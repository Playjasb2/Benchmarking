## Benchmarking Assignment

Contributors: [@Playjasb2](https://github.com/Playjasb2) and [@Jas03x](https://github.com/Jas03x).

The "process_activity" folder contains the experiment of part A. There is a file called "run_experiment_A.sh" which will compile the
program, and generate the results for the system.

Similarly, the "cache_test" folder contains the experiment for part B. There are 2 files called "run_experiment_B1.sh" and 
"run_experiment_B2.sh", which compile and generate the results.

Note that when you run an experiment file, the whole directory is cleaned. So if you want to keep some result, please copy it before running
the script again.

For more details, please see the appendix of the report.
